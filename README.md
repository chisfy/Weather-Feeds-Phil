Through the encouragement of my mentor, I was given the task to produce something with TypeScript and React to present in our next meeting. It stemmed from myself expressing that I'd like to explore and understand TypeScript more. So I dived into building a weather app, I decided this because I had fun building this in an early bootcamp hackathon and didn't quite get to complete it then. Creating the plan and flowchart, I realised this was rather rudimentary and to decided to incorporate a show I'm watching to make it more interesting to build and also use.

Regarding TypeScript, I gained a better understanding of its purpose and how it enhances code quality by eliminating assumptions through explicit data types. This project has underscored for me that TypeScript is indeed a powerful developer tool, especially within a team setting. Its usage promotes code uniformity, ensuring a consistent and cohesive codebase. The experience of encountering red lines prompts a direct confrontation of issues rather than merely ignoring them. This proactive approach, rather than "sweeping problems under the carpet," is essential in a professional or commercial setting, contributing significantly to the development of a higher-quality product.

Reflection:

What went well? <br>
Quick implementation of React, utilizing the component-based architecture for meticulous breakdowns of structure, even if it's minute, to set in good habits.
Smooth integration of built-in React Hooks such as useState and useContext.

What have I learnt? <br>
Strengthened my foundations in React, particularly understanding the precise role of useEffect.
Enhanced understanding of TypeScript and its syntax, especially when used with useContext.

What could be improved? <br>
Complexity of app, there's always room for another feature I could implement! Overall, it has been a good introduction to TypeScript.
CSS styling; improvement and a better approach to positioning elements rather than relying solely on divs.
Testing; I have yet to implement written tests, relying on developer environment testing and deployment checks.
