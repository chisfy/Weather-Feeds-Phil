## ✨ Inspiration

<p align="center">
Encouraged by my mentor, I undertook the task of creating something with TypeScript and React for our upcoming meeting. This initiative stemmed from my expressed desire to delve deeper into TypeScript. I chose to build a weather app, a project I had enjoyed during an early bootcamp hackathon but hadn't completed. As I crafted the plan and flowchart, I realized its simplicity and decided to incorporate details from a show I'm currently watching to make it more engaging.

## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
Through this, I have strengthened my foundations in React, particularly understanding the precise role of useEffect.
</p>
<p align="center">
Enhanced understanding of TypeScript and its syntax, especially when used with useContext.
</p>
<p align="center">
Regarding TypeScript, I gained a better understanding of its purpose and how it enhances code quality by eliminating assumptions through explicit data types. This project has underscored for me that TypeScript is indeed a powerful developer tool, especially within a team setting. Its usage promotes code uniformity, ensuring a consistent and cohesive codebase. The experience of encountering red lines prompts a direct confrontation of issues rather than merely ignoring them. This proactive approach, rather than "sweeping problems under the carpet," is essential in a professional or commercial setting, contributing significantly to the development of a higher-quality product.
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
Quick implementation of React, utilizing the component-based architecture for meticulous breakdowns of structure, even if it's minute, to set in good habits.
Smooth integration of built-in React Hooks such as useState and useContext.
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Complexity of app, there's always room for another feature I could implement! Overall, it has been a good introduction to TypeScript.
CSS styling; improvement and a better approach to positioning elements rather than relying solely on divs.
Testing; I have yet to implement written tests, relying on developer environment testing and deployment checks.
